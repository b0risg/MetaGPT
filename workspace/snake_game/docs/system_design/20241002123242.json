{"Implementation approach":"We will use the Pygame library to implement the snake game. Pygame is a set of Python modules designed for writing video games, which includes computer graphics and sound libraries. It is well-suited for this project as it provides the necessary tools to handle game loops, rendering, and user input. The game will be structured into two main files: `main.py` for initializing and running the game, and `game.py` for the game logic and mechanics. We will ensure smooth gameplay by optimizing the game loop and handling events efficiently. The game will feature increasing difficulty, score display, and a restart option.","File list":["main.py","game.py"],"Data structures and interfaces":"\nclassDiagram\n    class Game {\n        -int score\n        -int speed\n        -list snake\n        -tuple food\n        -bool game_over\n        +__init__()\n        +run()\n        +handle_events()\n        +update()\n        +draw(screen)\n        +reset()\n    }\n    class Main {\n        +main()\n    }\n    Main --> Game\n","Program call flow":"\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant M as Main\n    participant G as Game\n    M->>G: __init__()\n    M->>G: run()\n    loop Game Loop\n        G->>G: handle_events()\n        G->>G: update()\n        G->>G: draw(screen)\n    end\n    G->>M: game_over\n    M->>G: reset()\n","Anything UNCLEAR":"Clarify if there are any specific design preferences for the CLI interface or additional features desired."}
