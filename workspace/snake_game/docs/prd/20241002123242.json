The game should be easy to control, display the score, and increase in difficulty. Smooth performance and ease of restarting the game are also crucial.","Requirement Pool":[["P0","Implement basic snake movement using keyboard inputs"],["P0","Display the current score during gameplay"],["P1","Increase game difficulty as the player progresses"],["P1","Implement a restart feature after the player loses"],["P2","Ensure the game runs smoothly without lag"]],"UI Design draft":"The game will have a simple CLI interface. The snake will be represented by characters, and the score will be displayed at the top of the screen. The game will start immediately upon running, and players can use arrow keys to control the snake. A message will appear when the game is over, with an option to restart by pressing a key.","Anything UNCLEAR":"Clarify if there are any specific design preferences for the CLI interface or additional features desired."}
