## Implementation approach

We will use the Pygame library to implement the snake game. Pygame is a set of Python modules designed for writing video games, which includes computer graphics and sound libraries. It is well-suited for this project as it provides the necessary tools to handle game loops, rendering, and user input. The game will be structured into two main files: `main.py` for initializing and running the game, and `game.py` for the game logic and mechanics. We will ensure smooth gameplay by optimizing the game loop and handling events efficiently. The game will feature increasing difficulty, score display, and a restart option.

## File list

- main.py
- game.py

## Data structures and interfaces

    class Game {
        -int score
        -int speed
        -list snake
        -tuple food
        -bool game_over
        +__init__()
        +run()
        +handle_events()
        +update()
        +draw(screen)
        +reset()
    }
    class Main {
        +main()
    }
    Main --> Game


## Program call flow


sequenceDiagram
    participant M as Main
    participant G as Game
    M->>G: __init__()
    M->>G: run()
    loop Game Loop
        G->>G: handle_events()
        G->>G: update()
        G->>G: draw(screen)
    end
    G->>M: game_over
    M->>G: reset()


## Anything UNCLEAR

Clarify if there are any specific design preferences for the CLI interface or additional features desired.
