The game should provide clear instructions and feedback to the player, ensuring an intuitive user experience. The game logic must accurately reflect the rules of blackjack, and the user interface should be simple yet effective.","Requirement Pool":[["P0","The main code should initialize a new game and handle user inputs."],["P0","The game algorithm should accurately simulate blackjack rules."],["P1","The UI should display the player's and dealer's hands and scores."],["P1","The game should provide feedback on the outcome of each game."],["P2","The game should include a help command to display instructions."]],"UI Design draft":"The UI will be text-based, displaying the player's and dealer's hands and scores. Commands such as 'hit' and 'stand' will be available for user input. Feedback on the game's outcome will be provided at the end of each round. A help command will be available to display game instructions.","Anything UNCLEAR":"Clarify if there are any specific rules or variations of blackjack that need to be implemented."}
